# Dog-Classifier-App

[License](LICENSE)

One of Udacity's deep learning nanodegree is building a convolutional neural network to classify dog breeds.

By using part of Google's InceptionV3 network and my own trained classifier layer, I was able to classify dog breeds with around 83% accuracy.
Not too bad, but it is about the limit to which I can train in a small amount of time.

I built a simply GUI to supply images for classification. It should take any image format, but I limited it to jpeg and png.

If you want to try it out, install the requirements and run dog_classifier.py!

Enjoy!
